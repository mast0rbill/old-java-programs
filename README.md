# Old Java Programs

This is a showcase of extremely old Java applications which detail my introduction to programming. 

Surviver (mis-spelled): a rudimentary 3D engine written in Java, with randomly generated "walls".

AirHockey: a very simple game of air-hockey. My first time displaying external images.

CalculatorOriginal: one of my first programs at all. A simple calculator with rudimentary GUI.
