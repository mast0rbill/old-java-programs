This is a showcase of extremely old Java applications which detail my introduction to programming. 

ZombieSurvivorZ: my first 2D "game", demonstrating input handling and rudimentary AI.
Surviver (mis-spelled): a rudimentary 3D engine written in Java, with randomly generated "walls".
AirHockey: a very simple game of air-hockey. My first time displaying external images.
CalculatorOriginal: one of my first programs at all. A simple calculator with rudimentary GUI.
