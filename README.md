# Old Java Programs

This is a showcase of old Java applications which demonstrate my introduction to programming. 

Survivor: a rudimentary 3D engine written in Java's LWJGL OpenGL wrapper, with randomly generated "walls". Includes movement and rotation and a simple vertex-lit shader. Followed a tutorial from YouTube.

AirHockey: a very simple game of air-hockey. Includes external images and rudimentary implementation of two-dimensional collision and physics.

CalculatorOriginal: one of my first programming projects written in Java. A simple calculator with JSwing GUI.
